Amy Moore blew her top
Stole a car, shot a cop
Sped away 2000 miles
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans

That's alright, there's just one thing
Her wedding ring, or anything
She left behind, forgot to pack
How the hell is she gonna get it back?

Paperface
Paperface

I never heard of paperface
Until I moves to the West Coast
Where I found that to be smooth
I had to wear a paperface

That's alright there's just one thing
How am I supposed to sing?
With this thing in my way
With this thing in my face
Paperface, paperface, paperface

Only hope to see
See what's underneath
Only hope to be
Me that's underneath

How the hell is she gonna get it back?

Paperface, paperface
Paperface, paperface, yeah, yeah
Paperface, paperface
Paperface, paper, paperface
