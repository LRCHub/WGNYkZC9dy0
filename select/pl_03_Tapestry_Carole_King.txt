Have you seen the seven oceans?
Or the snow cap
of a mountain top?
Or the northern lights set
in motion?
Or a heartbeat slowed to a stop?
Have you read a book
by candle light?
Or heard a leader's
call to arms?
Have you ever felt my love burn
so bright?
Like a fireball in your palms
More than all the things
that I have seen
You will always be
part of my tapestry
More than all the places
I've been
You will always be
part of my tapestry
Have you felt a revolution?
Do you ever sit
to stop and pause?
Just to take a little moment
To see what's mine and yours
More than all the things
that I have seen
You will always be
part of my tapestry
More than all the places
I've been
You will always be
part of my tapestry
These are just lines of latitude
That we made up,
drawn upon a map
We could be meeting
with more than minds
We could be woven
and intertwined
More than all the things
that I have seen
You will always be
part of my tapestry
More than all the places
I've been
You will always be
part of my tapestry
